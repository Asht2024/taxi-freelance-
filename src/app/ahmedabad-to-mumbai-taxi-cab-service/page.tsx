            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Ahmedabad cab services are widely available across the city, offering comfortable rides. However, for long-distance travel, such as the Ahmedabad to Mumbai cab service, choosing a one-way cab is the most recommended option. The primary reason is that passengers traveling such a long distance do not need to share the ride with others. This means they will have a dedicated taxi, ensuring greater privacy.
